# atom.io language-matlab-only package

I forked this repofrom thedavidprice and noticed that it's not working very nice (maybe a windows issue..).

I dont use octave, so I just got rid of octave parts and also modified some snippets to work properly under Atom (i.e. as far as I understand, atom cant -yet- get filename or things like that in snippets).

As time passes I might add more snippets to it. 

I also found out that best syntax to go with this language pack is the sublime-default-syntax (https://atom.io/themes/sublime-default-syntax)

Features:
- Optimized for Atom (removed TextMark specific stuff)
- Matlab only

Atom.io language support for Matlab only converted from TextMate Bundle:
